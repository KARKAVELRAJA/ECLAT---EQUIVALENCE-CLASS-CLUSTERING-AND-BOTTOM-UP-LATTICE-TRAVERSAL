# ECLAT---EQUIVALENCE-CLASS-CLUSTERING-AND-BOTTOM-UP-LATTICE-TRAVERSAL

### MARKET BASKET ANALYSIS USING ECLAT ALGORITHM

- ECLAT is one of the popular methods of Association Rule mining
- The ECLAT algorithm works in a vertical manner just like the Depth-First Search of a graph
- This vertical approach of the ECLAT algorithm makes it a faster algorithm than the Apriori algorithm which follows horizontal approach (Breadth-First Search)
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using ECLAT MODEL, the pre-processed data are trained
- Finally, the output is predicted
